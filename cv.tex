       {\emph{Serverless \& massively scalable web app with AWS\hfill{}Lead Developer}

       \begin{adjustwidth}{0em}{3em}

       \sloppy{}Used Docker to productionise a Bayesian network model
       (implemented in R), parameterised PDF report and data visualisation generation,
       via AWS Lambda and API Gateway
       (\href{https://github.com/nationalarchives/diagram/tree/live/api}%
             {\texttt{github.com/nationalarchives/diagram/tree/live/api}}).

       Developed Terraform for IaC, provisioning development, staging and production environments
       (\href{https://github.com/nationalarchives/DiAGRAM-terraform/}%
             {\texttt{github.com/nationalarchives/DiAGRAM-terraform}}).

       Automated front and backend deployment, controlling application life
       cycle with GitHub and GitHub Actions.

\faitem{\faIcon{microsoft}}{3.25em}%
       {\emph{Azure Databricks \& App Service for ETL\hfill{}Lead Developer}

       \begin{adjustwidth}{0em}{3em}

       Administered Databricks and prepared init scripts for R workloads.

       Adapted existing ETL R scripts to write results to blob storage via
       \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AzureStor/vignettes/intro.html}%
            {\{AzureStor\}}.

       Improved typical application deploy time from $\sim$20mins to $\sim$2--3mins.
